Description: This package facilitates application of Clique-Extracted Ontology
    (CliXO) algorithm in R. This algorithm was originally implemented in C++ by
    Michael Kramer. The input is a feature similarity matrix, while the output
    is an ontology source-target-similarity-relation data frame.
